I wrote a tweet yesterday that turned out pretty good, so I thought I'd give it a proper home on my blog. Enjoy!

Last week, I resurrected an old niche Facebook page that I created a few years ago that has around 1,000 likes. The page hasn't grown at all for years, and I've never felt like anything I ever did resulted in any real growth.

However, this time I was determined to figure out how to build an audience without spending any money on advertising, and the results were astonishing!

Here's what I learned:

1. Share valuable content, and don't be afraid to share other people's content. (Especially if it's trending or useful)
2. Share what people need, or want, to read. Create posts with your audience in mind.
3. Take the time to connect with your viewers, it only takes a few seconds to write replies, and this kind of connection goes a long way when building your brand.
4. Be Consistent! It takes time to gain traction, and if your stop posting why should anyone follow you? If there is no news to share about your products, share news about something else.

If you actually start posting content, you may see results similar to the photograph below, which shows the analytics dashboard of my long forgotten Facebook page.

My page was dead until last week when I started posting good content everyday, multiple times a day. The result? **I think I broke the internet!**

Unsure of what to share, or not getting any attention on your posts? Try something that's really trending or interesting and you'll see a lot more engagement on your posts/tweets. Use Feedly or Google Trends/Alerts to keep up with what's trending for certain topics, or if you have some extra cash to spend I highly recommend using [BuzzSumo](http://buzzsumo.com/) (and they aren't paying me anything to say that)
