You may be wondering what's all this buzz about HTTPS/SSL Certificates. Well, since July 2018, Google is requiring webmasters secure their sites with SSL. Since the release of version 62, Google Chrome will require websites with input fields to have an SSL certificate installed and configured on their website. If you don't have an SSL certificate an error will be displayed that advises users that the website is not safe to enter their information. This doesn't look good from the visitors point of view, and actually puts them at risk if your website accepts their name, e-mail, phone number, etc.

## Why you need an HTTPS domain.

In order to protect yourself, and your website's reputation, you'll need to secure your website with an SSL certificate. SSL certificates can cost up to $120, and there are different kinds of SSL certificates. You may be wondering, "If there are different kinds of SSL certificates, which one do I need?" - which is a great question, I'll explain:

SSL certificates can secure credit card transations, logins, data transfers and more. Some certificates have a warranty as high as 10 million dollars, some certificates protect one domain, some protect many domains. If you run a big corporation, and process millions of user's data on your website, then I would suggest doing a little research into what kind of SSL certificate is right for your business.

## I'm on a budget, what are my options?

If you are on a budget, you can even secure your website for free using an awesome service called [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). (https://letsencrypt.org/)

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a free, and open source service provided by the Internet Security Research Group. Their mission is to provide people with the SSL certificates they need in order to secure their websites, for free. Their intent behind their mission is to create a more secure and privacy respecting web, and I think that's really awesome!

## Get HTTPS for Free

Let's Encrypt has very thorough documentation on their website to use their API, but I've found a very handy resource that I'm going to share with you today that makes it even easier to secure your website with Let's Encrypt. The handy resource I'm talking about is a website called [Get HTTPS for free!](https://gethttpsforfree.com/) This website walks you through the process of setting up an SSL certificate on your server using Let's Encrypt. The only downside is that the certificate expires every 3 months, and must be renewed. The whole process only takes about 1 hour, so it's not that much of an inconvenience to renew it every 3 months.

However, this does require a little bit of technical expertise, but you can find a freelancer on UpWork to do it for you. It only takes an hour, so it shouldn't cost very much to hire someone to help you out. If you need some help hiring a freelancer, I would suggest checking out this article I wrote a couple of weeks ago that includes some [tips for hiring freelancers](https://coffeywebdev.com/how-to-hire-feelancers-on-upwork-so-you-can-relax-by-the-pool/), check it out!
